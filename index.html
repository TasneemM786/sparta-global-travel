        <h2>Choosing a City Break</h2>
        <p>Sometimes, when you just need to escape for a couple of days, where better than a city with a completely different culture, where you can immerse yourself in an entirely new part of the world? Every city has a unique story, so whether you travel near or far, you’ll be sure to make great memories.

Cities are easily accessible, simpler to organise getaways to, and full of activities. So which one do you choose? Here are some of the best ways that the travel pros themselves choose their getaway locations.</p>
<br>
<p>“People often choose far off destinations for a city break. They want something exotic and unfamiliar. But that often means they forget amazing places in their own country, just a couple hours away.

“But choosing somewhere in your own country is less hassle, as you don’t need a passport or to change currency. One of my favourite city breaks is Montreal, which is only four hours by train or less than two hours by flight, but you would be surprised how many Torontonians have been to Paris but not Montreal.

“Even if you’ve been to the major cities it’s wonderful to learn more about your own country. Find somewhere rural to go - now that is a true city break.”</p>
